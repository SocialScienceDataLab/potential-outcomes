# Introduction to the Potential Outcomes Framework
Introduction to the Potential Outcomes Framework. Input Talk, Mannheim Centre for European Social Research, September 10, 2019.

### Abstract
This talk introduces participants to the potential outcomes framework, one of the primary approaches to causality in the social sciences and beyond. The talk covers the basic intuition of counterfactual causality as well as the fundamental problem of causal inference and relates core assumptions of frequently used identification strategies to the potential outcomes framework. A hands-on simulation exercise allows participants to apply the framework to artificial data and to further their understanding of biases in causal quantities of interest when core assumptions are violated.
